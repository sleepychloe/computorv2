## Computorv2

### Introduction

This project focuses on developing a powerful mathematical interpreter that can handle complex computations.

Computorv2 combines versatility and precision to process a wide range of mathematical constructs.

It allows users to solve equations, manipulate variables, and perform matrix operations effortlessly within an intuitive command-line interface.

### Project description

Computor v2 is an instruction-based mathematical interpreter that facilitates advanced computations in a structured environment.

It is designed to handle a various mathematical types and operations while maintaining user-friendly interaction.

The interpreter supports the following features:

- variable assignments: rational numbers, complex numbers, matrices, and polynomial functions
- mathematical operations: basic arithmetic, matrix multiplication, powers, and modulos
- equation resolution Solve polynomial equations up to degree 2 with real or complex solutions
- function handling: define, evaluate, and compose single-variable functions.

### Mandatory Part

the primary goal is to develop a fully functional mathematical interpreter capable of:

- managing diverse mathematical types and operations
- resolving equations with accuracy and efficiency
- handling variable assignments and reassignments

the interpreter must be robust, ensuring correct results and preventing errors during user interaction.

### Parsing with the class ReadLine

To streamline the parsing process and enhance input handling, computor v2 leverages a custom-built utility class called `ReadLine`.

This class was specifically developed to handle user input efficiently, ensuring a smoother and more intuitive parsing.
